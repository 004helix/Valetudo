## Viomi

3irobotix is the manufacturer of vacuum robots sold under various brand names including
- Viomi 
- Cecotec
- Prosenic
- Kyvol
- Neabot

For now, only one vacuum robot is supported (WIP):
* Mijia STYJ02YM **viomi.vacuum.v7**

To install Valetudo on your Viomi V7, follow the instructions found [here](https://valetudo.cloud/pages/installation/viomi.html).

We're currently looking into the possibility of reflashing other brands to Viomi so that they work with Valetudo without
any additional code.
