# Buying supported robots

The recommended source to buy a [supported robot](https://valetudo.cloud/pages/general/supported-robots.html) is
wherever it is cheapest. After rooting, you won't have any warranty anyways, which is why buying local usually doesn't
offer any benefits apart from higher prices.

In general, when buying something, you should always use price comparison websites, shopping communities, check Aliexpress etc.


## Affiliate links

It has come to my attention that there are other people trying to make money off Valetudo by using it to get people to
click on their affiliate links. Therefore, I've decided to have my own affiliate links. I'm not exactly happy with this,
however if people want to use such things, they should at least use them in a way where the money ends up supporting the project.

If you want to support the project, consider donating using [Github sponsors](https://github.com/sponsors/Hypfer) instead
of using affiliate links as they are part of the advertising industry, which [some people might describe as bad](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tHEOGrkhDp0).

## Germany

For price comparison, check out [geizhals.de](https://geizhals.de) or [idealo.de](https://idealo.de).
Also, don't forget [mydealz.de](https://mydealz.de) and of course [Aliexpress](https://de.aliexpress.com/).

If Amazon is something that you like to use, here are some **affiliate links** for it:
