# Valetudo - Free your vacuum from the cloud

[![Build Status](https://travis-ci.com/Hypfer/Valetudo.svg?branch=master)](https://travis-ci.com/Hypfer/Valetudo)

Valetudo is a standalone binary which runs on **rooted Xiaomi Vacuums** and aims to enable the user to operate the robot vacuum without any Cloud Connection whatsoever.

Valetudo **provides (almost) all settings and controls** of the Xiaomi Vacuum in a **mobile-friendly webinterface** as well as optional **MQTT** Connectivity which supports **Home Assistant Autodiscovery**.

This Project is made possible by the work of many voluntary contributers. ‚ù§

### Supported Hardware
As of now, only **Gen1 + Gen2 Xiaomi Vacuums** are rootable and hence supported by Valetudo.

### Getting started
For newcomers, there is [a simple Guide](https://github.com/dgiese/dustcloud/wiki/Cloud-Free-Firmware-Image-With-Valetudo) which will walk you through the process of rooting a factory-new Vacuum and installing Valetudo on it.

The configuration file stored in `/mnt/data/valetudo/config.json` survives firmware upgrades.
The Valetudo binary however does not so if you are upgrading your firmware, you will have to follow said guide again.

### Currently supported Features
* Live Map View
* Go-To
* Zoned Cleanup
* Configure Timers
* MQTT
* MQTT HomeAssistant Autodiscovery
* Start/Stop/Pause Robot

#### Updating to newer versions
1. Stop the running service `service valetudo stop`.
2. Replace the binary `/usr/local/bin/valetudo` by the new one (make sure to `chmod +x` it).
3. Start the service again `service valetudo start`.

### Misc
Valetudo does not feature access controls and I'm not planning on adding it since I trust my local network.
You could just put a reverse proxy with authentication in front of it if you really need it.

Please don't just forward the port to make it accessible on the go..

### FAQ
**Q:** Why the name?

**A:** Valetudo is the roman name for the greek goddess Hygieia which is the goddess of health, cleanliness and hygiene. Also I'm bad at naming things.
