<!--
    While of course appreciated, please don't open PRs with features without discussing them first.
    _Especially_ if it's a new capability.

    New features will only be accepted if the scope as well as the requirements have been defined in a separate discussion
    Please only open the PR after it is clear what it should do and what it shouldn't.
    
    PRs won't be merged otherwise
